### Test
* Test Suites
The unit test utilize the assertion testing of the node.js. Error messages will be generated for any tests failures.

* Advanced Testing
Test generation is used for advanced testing. Esprima is used to parse the source code and generate input based on constraints. Coverage report will be generated by the Instanbul for measurement purpose.

### Analysis
* Basic Analysis
PMD is implemented for the analysis of source code. Any conflictions with ruleset will be reported.

* Custom Metrics
The longest method and the number of conditions within an if statements is tested. 
We set the threshold for number of lines within a function as 30, and the maximum condition allowed in an if state to be 2. Error message will be generated for any violation of this rule.

* Gates
The gates is realized via pre-commit hooks. The script will invoke each module and collect the result.
If the criteria is not met, (i.e. 95% of Statement Coverag/ 5 PMD warnings/ failing testcases / Violation against custom metrics), the commit will be rejected by returning a non-zero error code. The reason to reject the commit will also be posted.
